15.Create a new list with the converted numbers. If something cannot be converted, skip it and append nothing to the new list.

Hint: Use a try-except statement, see here or here.

Answer:

corrupted = ['!1', '23.1', '23.4.5', '??12', '.12', '12-12', '-11.1', '0-1', '*12.1', '1000']
new_corrupted = []
for item in corrupted:
    try:
        my_num = float(item) 
        print('{} can be converted'.format(item))
        new_corrupted.append(item)
    except:
        print('{} can not be converted'.format(item))
print(new_corrupted)    


16. While loops and strings.
Iterate over the following sentence over and over again, counting the number of vowels in the sentence until you have counted 1 million vowels. Print out the number of iterations it took to reach one million.
Answer:
sentence = "IF I PRACTICE A LOT I WILL SOON BECOME A VERY GOOD DATA ANALYST"
i = 0 
count_vowel = 0
for i in sentence:
    if i in ('A','E','I','O','U'):
        count_vowel += 1
print(count_vowel)
22
count_read = 1000000/22
print(round(count_read))
45455
